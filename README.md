# SpeebrunConsistencyTracker

A Celeste mod designed to help speedrunners focus on measuring and improving consistency. Track segment and room times with real-time statistics to emphasize repeatability over PBs

## High-level Features

- HUD that shows real-time stats at the end of each completed attempts
- Scatter Plots and Histograms: Visualize your times distribution for individual rooms and the whole segment
- Generate data exports including metrics for segments, individual rooms, and practice session history (csv format)

## Usage

### 1. Training Workflow

* **Set a Save State:** Starting a new training session. Creating or clearing a save state will reset all current session data
* **Run the Segment:** Practice the segment as you usually do. To maintain data integrity, **make sure that the "current room / next room" SpeedrunTool setting is properly configured**
* **Review Performance:** After every completed run, a customizable overlay displays your session statistics. You can also view various performance charts in-game via your configured keybinds (my personal recommendation is to use the default menu directions to cycle through them)

### 2. Real-Time Feedback & Overlays

Configure the overlay to display the metrics that matter most to your current goals:

* **Target Time Tracking:** Define a goal time for the segment and track your **Success Rate** in real-time
* **Live Histograms and Scatter plot:** Cycle through times distribution charts for the **entire segment** or **individual rooms** to see where your times are clustering (hotkeys needed)

### 3. Exporting

* **Data Export:** Export your complete session history and statistics to CSV (exported files are saved to the /SCT_Exports directory within your Celeste's installation folder)

## Available Metrics

- History: chronological history of session times
- Success Rate: (segment only) percentage of runs finishing within the target time
- Dnf Count: number of runs that did not finish (for rooms: number of DNFs occurring in that room)
- Completed Run Count: number of runs that did finish (for rooms: number of runs that cleared the room)
- Total Run Count: dnf count + completed run count
- Average: average time across all completed runs
- Median: middle value of the run time distribution
- Reset Rate: the ratio of dnf runs over the total number of runs
- Reset Share: (Rooms only), the contribution of this room in total number of reset
- Best: fastest recorded time
- Worst: slowest recorded time
- Standard Deviation: measure of how spread out the run times are around the average
- Relative Standard Deviation: Standard Deviation as a percentage of the average, allowing easier comparison across different segments / rooms
- Percentile: n% of your runs were faster than the selected value for n
- Interquartile Range: the lower and upper bound of the middle 50% of your runs (first and third quarter basically)
- Trend Slope: measures how session duration affects performance. Values closer to zero indicate little effect, while negative values indicate that your times tend to improve as the session progresses, whereas positive values indicate the opposite
- SoB: Sum of Best
- Median Absolute Deviation: measure of how spread out the run times are around the median
- Consistency Score: Composite metric estimating how consistent times are. Tighter distributions, times closer to the best, and fewer resets result in a higher score.
- Bimodal Test: detects multiple peaks in the time distribution indicating an hit-or-miss strat in a room. The Bimodality Coefficient is to be compared to the critical tresholf of 0.555 which indicates an uniform distribution; higher values point towards bimodality, whereas lower values point toward unimodality.
- Room Dependency: measures how a poor time in a room impacts the next room, ranging from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no effect, while a high positive score suggests that a mistake in a room often leads to a bad time in the following room.

## Limitations

- Multiple save states are not supported
- Updating current room / next room during an active session will cause inconsistencies in the data
